ROC can be used to determine the overal market trend.

- 1M / 3M / 6M / 12M ROCs can be computed and if all four ROCs are positive, we claim the market is uptrend.

For all other cases, we conclude that the market is in a range market without clear direction, and we simply don't trade those markets.
